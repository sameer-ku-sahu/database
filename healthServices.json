Your dedicated coach will either be a PT, PTA, or Exercise Therapist.\nThe initial telephone or video consultation is 30 minutes and subsequent coaching is either via direct messaging, telephone, or video chat. SpineZone’s medical team (MD, NP, PA) provides telephone and video consultation to discuss XR/MRI findings, offer further program customizations, and discuss the appropriateness for surgery."},{"question":"What if my back or neck pain gets worse during the online program or if I need an XR or MRI or I need to see a surgeon?","answer":"Committing to the SpineZone program ensures you have a complete medical team following your progress to address any issue that may arise. As SpineZone is creating a new way to address your health and is working on parts of the body that likely haven't been activated for a long time, it’s not uncommon to have an initial flare of pain. \nAfter each exercise, you can give feedback to your coach. This feedback is critical for us to further learn the exact right program for you. Based on your comments, your SpineZone coach will be notified and reach out to you about your pain and adjust your program. Further customizations occur with the medical team weekly when needed. \nIf pain is still worsening"}],"symptomList":["Back/Neck pain","Leg/Buttock pain","Sciatica","Arm pain","Whiplash","Back/Neck Disc Hemiation","Back/Neck Stenosis","Surgical 2nd Opinion","Back/Neck Fusion","Spine Surgery","Degenerative Disc","Radiculopathy","Failed back","Facet Syndrome","Scoliosis","Spondylolysis","Spondylolisthesis","Sacroiliac pain","Piriformis Syndrome","Osteoporosis","Osteopenia","Adjacent disc disease","Laminectomy","Discectomy"],"disclaimers":[{"ordinal":{"$numberInt":"1"},"text":"Walgreens Find Care allows certain healthcare providers that have contracted with Walgreens to advertise and provide information to consumers about their respective healthcare services."},{"ordinal":{"$numberInt":"2"},"text":"All healthcare organizations listed in the Find Care tool have contracted with Walgreens to be listed on these webpages and to display information that they have provided about their services.
